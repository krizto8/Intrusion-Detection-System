            <h5>Definition</h5>
            <p>A Brute Force attack is a cryptographic hack that relies on guessing possible combinations of a targeted password until the correct password is discovered. The name "Brute Force" comes from attackers using excessively forceful attempts to gain access to user accounts.

            <br/><br/>This attack method is old but still popular and effective. It's a simple yet reliable way for attackers to gain unauthorized access to individual accounts and organizations. While modern encryption methods are more robust, brute force attacks can still be successful when users have weak or easily guessable passwords.</p>
             <h5>How Bruteforce Works</h5>
             <p>Brute force attacks work by calculating every possible combination that could make up a password and testing it to see if it is the correct password. The attacker systematically checks all possible passwords until the correct one is found. The time it takes to find the correct password is determined by the length and complexity of the password.

             <br/><br/>There are several types of brute force attacks:

             <br/><br/>1. <span id="bold">Simple Brute Force:</span> The attacker tries each password one by one.

             <br/><br/>2. <span id="bold">Dictionary Attack:</span> The attacker uses a predefined list of words commonly used in passwords.

             <br/><br/>3. <span id="bold">Hybrid Brute Force:</span> Combines dictionary and traditional brute force approaches.

             <br/><br/>4. <span id="bold">Reverse Brute Force:</span> The attacker has the password and tries it against multiple usernames.

             <br/><br/>5. <span id="bold">Credential Stuffing:</span> The attacker uses previously breached username and password pairs.</p>
             <h5>How to Protect Yourself from Bruteforce Attacks</h5>
             <p><ol>
                <li><span id="bold">Use strong, unique passwords:</span> Create complex passwords that are at least 12 characters long, including a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.</li>
                <br/><li><span id="bold">Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA):</span> MFA adds an extra layer of security beyond just a password, making it much harder for attackers to gain access even if they crack the password.</li>
                <br/><li><span id="bold">Limit login attempts:</span> Implement account lockouts after a certain number of failed login attempts to prevent continuous guessing.</li>
                <br/><li><span id="bold">Use CAPTCHA:</span> Implement CAPTCHA systems to distinguish between human users and automated attacks.</li>
                <br/><li><span id="bold">Regularly update passwords:</span> Change passwords periodically, especially for critical accounts.</li>
                <br/><li><span id="bold">Use a password manager:</span> Password managers can generate and store strong, unique passwords for each of your accounts.</li>
                <br/><li><span id="bold">Monitor for suspicious activity:</span> Implement systems to detect and alert on unusual login patterns or multiple failed login attempts.</li>
